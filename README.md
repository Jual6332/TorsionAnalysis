# TortionTesting
Calculate torsional response for Closed-Thin Walled and Open Thin-Walled theory, then compare with experimental data.

## Background
For background into the experiment, and the comparison parameters see the files "Lab 1 Description Document.pdf" and "What to Compare.pdf"

## Running the Solution Code
Main.m script calls all necessary functions for completing the lab calculations. This file calls
* calcDataCTW.m - This file calculates the results for CTW Theory, and compares to experimental CTW data
* calcDataOTW.m - This file calculates the results for OTW Theory, and compares to experimental OTW data
* calcErrorCTW.m - This file calculates the error associated with the experimental CTW data
* calcErrorOTW.m - This file calculates the error associated with the experimental OTW data

## Plotted Results
