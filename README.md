# TortionTesting
Calculate torsional response for Closed-Thin Walled and Open Thin-Walled theory, then compare with experimental data.

## Running the Code
Main.m script calls all necessary functions for completing the lab calculations. This file calls
* calcDataCTW.m - This file calculates the results for CTW Theory, and compares to experimental CTW data
* calcDataOTW.m - This file calculates the results for OTW Theory, and compares to experimental OTW data
* calcErrorCTW.m - This file calculates the error associated with the experimental CTW data
* calcErrorOTW.m - This file calculates the error associated with the experimental OTW data
